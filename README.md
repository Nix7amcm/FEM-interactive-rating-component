## Overview

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge was to build a rating submission card compenent, where the DOM is updated using JS when the user interacts with the elements.

üöÄ I built this with the help of [Andreas Remdt's live code video](https://www.youtube.com/@AndreasRemdt), mainly for the JS! I learned a lot about adding the user interaction in simple ways, also animation implementation and even adding sounds! I also picked up useful tips on responsiveness and accessibility.

### Challenge Requirements

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me add [fallback fonts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family) to cover all browsers, and the [sr-only](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers#screen-reader-only-elements) class styles for accessibility.
- [Zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/) - This is an amazing resource for downloading free sounds to use in your projects! Don't forget to credit them!
